In this problem, we'll focus on one specific type of property crime, called \"motor vehicle theft\" (sometimes referred to as grand theft auto). This is the act of stealing, or attempting to steal, a car. In this problem, we'll use some basic data analysis in R to understand the motor vehicle thefts in Chicago.\n\nPlease download the file [mvtWeek1.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/96f9b8f751467da3a4b8a5be33e32905/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/mvtWeek1.csv) for this problem (do not open this file in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem because it might change the format of the Date field).\n\n***Start:***\\\nRead the dataset mvtWeek1.csv into R, using the read.csv function, and call the data frame \"mvt\".\n\n```{r}\nmvt <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/mvtWeek1.csv\")\n```\n\n**1.1: How many rows of data (observations) are in this dataset?**\\\nAnswer: 191641\n\n```{r}\nnrow(mvt)\n```\n\n**1.2: How many variables are in this dataset?**\\\nAnswer: 11\n\n```{r}\nncol(mvt)\n```\n\n**1.3: Using the \"max\" function, what is the maximum value of the variable \"ID\"?**\\\nAnswer: 9181151\n\n```{r}\nmax(mvt$ID)\n```\n\n**1.4: What is the minimum value of the variable \"Beat\"?**\\\nAnswer: 111\n\n```{r}\nmin(mvt$Beat)\n```\n\n**1.5: How many observations have value TRUE in the Arrest variable (this is the number of crimes for which an arrest was made)?**\\\nAnswer: 15536\n\n```{r}\nsum(mvt$Arrest)\n```\n\n**1.6: How many observations have a LocationDescription value of ALLEY?**\\\nAnswer: 2308\n\n```{r}\nsum(mvt$LocationDescription == \"ALLEY\")\n```\n\n**2.1: In what format are the entries in the variable Date?**\\\nAnswer: Month/Day/Year Hour:Minute\n\n```{r}\nmvt$Date[1]\n```\n\n**2.2: What is the month and year of the median date in our dataset?

The size of the world stock market is now estimated to be in the trillions. The largest stock market in the world is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located in New York City. About 2,800 companies are listed on the NYSE. In this problem, we'll look at the monthly stock prices of five of these companies: IBM, General Electric (GE), Procter and Gamble, Coca Cola, and Boeing. The data used in this problem comes from Infochimps.\n\nPlease download the following files: [IBMStock.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/4fc08d10f171aacf2ef61c6b4b5bb4d8/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/IBMStock.csv), [GEStock.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/448b8be4693d913c2b5153be0c0e25d6/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/GEStock.csv), [ProcterGambleStock.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/bb6ed54230b5b2e29fb66819ed535da0/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/ProcterGambleStock.csv), [CocaColaStock.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/4c30fd7f4f55e537989ca13a6db36289/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/CocaColaStock.csv), [BoeingStock.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/2e8c9fb294db48e5a999c747b317722d/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/BoeingStock.csv) (do not open these files in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem because it might change the format of the Date field).\n\n***Start:***\\\n1. Read the datasets into R, using the read.csv function, and call the data frames \"IBM\", \"GE\", \"ProcterGamble\", \"CocaCola\", and \"Boeing\", respectively.\n\n```{r}\nIBM <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/IBMStock.csv\")\nGE <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/GEStock.csv\")\nProcterGamble <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/ProcterGambleStock.csv\")\nCocaCola <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/CocaColaStock.csv\")\nBoeing <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/BoeingStock.csv\")\n```\n\n2\\. Before working with these data sets, we need to convert the dates into a format that R can understand. Take a look at the structure of one of the datasets using the str function. Right now, the date variable is stored as a factor. We can convert this to a \"Date\" object in R by using the following five commands (one for each data set):\n\n```{r}\nIBM$Date = as.Date(IBM$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nGE$Date = as.Date(GE$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nCocaCola$Date = as.Date(CocaCola$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nProcterGamble$Date = as.Date(ProcterGamble$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nBoeing$Date = as.Date(Boeing$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\n```\n\n**1.1: Our five datasets all have the same number of observations. How many observations are there in each data set?**\\\nAnswer: 480\n\n```{r}\nnrow(IBM)\n# According to the assignment, use: str(IBM)\n# We only need to use the command for one of the datasets, since they all have the same number of obs.\n```\n\n**1.2: What is the earliest year in our datasets?**\\\nAnswer: 1970\n\n```{r}\nmin(IBM$Date)\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$Date)\n# Again, we only need to use the command for one of the datsets, since the observations started on the same date.\n```\n\n**1.3: What is the latest year in our datasets?**\\\nAnswer: 2009\n\n```{r}\nmax(IBM$Date)\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$Date)\n# Again, we only need to use the command for one of the datsets, since the observations ended on the same date.\n```\n\n**1.4: What is the mean stock price of IBM over this time period?**\\\nAnswer: 144.375\n\n```{r}\nmean(IBM$StockPrice)\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$StockPrice)\n```\n\n**1.5: What is the minimum stock price of General Electric (GE) over this time period?**\\\nAnswer: 9.293636\n\n```{r}\nmin(GE$StockPrice)\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(GE$StockPrice)\n```\n\n**1.6: What is the maximum stock price of Coca-Cola over this time period?**\\\nAnswer: 146.5843\n\n```{r}\nmax(CocaCola$StockPrice)\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(CocaCola$StockPrice)\n```\n\n**1.7: What is the median stock price of Boeing over this time period?**\\\nAnswer:\n\n```{r}\nmedian(Boeing$StockPrice)\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(Boeing$StockPrice)\n```\n\n**1.8: What is the standard deviation of the stock price of Procter & Gamble over this time period?**\\\nAnswer: 18.19414\n\n```{r}\nsd(ProcterGamble$StockPrice)\n```\n\nSide note: According to the assignment, questions 1.2 - 1.7 should've been solved using the summary function. However, I used commands that would give more accurate answer. Along with the commands I used, I also wrote how the assignment could be solved using the summary function.\n\n**2.1.1: Around what year did Coca-Cola has its highest stock price in this time period?**\\\nAnswer: 1973\n\n**2.1.2: Around what year did Coca-Cola has its lowest stock price in this time period?**\\\nAnswer: 1980\n\n```{r}\nplot(CocaCola$Date, CocaCola$StockPrice, \"l\")\n```\n\n**2.2: In March of 2000, the technology bubble burst, and a stock market crash occurred.

In the United States, the government measures unemployment using the Current Population Survey (CPS), which collects demographic and employment information from a wide range of Americans each month. In this exercise, we will employ the topics reviewed in the lectures as well as a few new techniques using the September 2013 version of this rich, nationally representative dataset (available online).\n\nThe observations in the dataset represent people surveyed in the September 2013 CPS who actually completed a survey. While the full dataset has 385 variables, in this exercise we will use a more compact version of the dataset.\n\nPlease dowload the following file: [CPSData.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/f041f6c100061fc06bc3b6320e6512fa/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/CPSData.csv)\n\n***Start:***\\\nLoad the dataset from CPSData.csv into a data frame called CPS.\n\n```{r}\nCPS <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/CPSData.csv\")\n```\n\n**1.1: How many interviewees are in the dataset?**\\\nAnswer: 131302\n\n```{r}\nnrow(CPS)\n```\n\n**1.2: Among the interviewees with a value reported for the Industry variable, what is the most common industry of employment?**\\\nAnswer: Educational and health services\n\n```{r}\nhead(sort(table(CPS$Industry), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n```\n\n**1.3.1: Which state has the fewest interviewees?**\\\nAnswer: New Mexico\n\n```{r}\ntail(sort(table(CPS$State), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n```\n\n**1.3.2: Which state has the largest number of interviewees?**\\\nAnswer: California\n\n```{r}\nhead(sort(table(CPS$State), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n```\n\n**1.4: What proportion of interviewees are citizens of the United States?**\\\nAnswer: 0.9421943\n\n```{r}\ntable(CPS$Citizenship)\n(116639+7073)/nrow(CPS)\n```\n\n**1.5: For which races are there at least 250 interviewees in the CPS dataset of Hispanic ethnicity?**\\\nAnswer: American Indian, Black, Multiracial, White\n\n```{r}\ntable(CPS$Race, CPS$Hispanic) > 250\n```\n\n**2.1: Which variables have at least one interviewee with a missing (NA) value?**\\\nAnswer: MetroAreaCode, Married, Education, EmploymentStatus, Industry\n\n```{r}\nsum(is.na(CPS$PeopleInHousehold)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Region)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$State)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$MetroAreaCode)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Age)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Married)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Sex)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Education)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Race)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Hispanic)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$CountryOfBirthCode)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Citizenship)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$EmploymentStatus)) > 0\nsum(is.na(CPS$Industry)) > 0\n```\n\n**2.2: We will try to determine if there is a pattern in the missing values of the Married variable.**\\\nAnswer: The Married variable being missing is related to the Age value for the interviewee.\n\n```{r}\ntable(CPS$Region, is.na(CPS$Married))\ntable(CPS$Sex, is.na(CPS$Married))\ntable(CPS$Age, is.na(CPS$Married))\ntable(CPS$Citizenship, is.na(CPS$Married))\n```\n\n**2.3.1: How many states had all interviewees living in a non-metropolitan area (aka they have a missing MetroAreaCode value)?

In fact, all but one of the variables in this dataset were actually stored by a numeric code in the original CPS datafile.\n\nWhen analyzing a variable stored by a numeric code, we will often want to convert it into the values the codes represent. To do this, we will use a dictionary, which maps the the code to the actual value of the variable. We have provided dictionaries [MetroAreaCodes.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/fd88455abc1b5b69112daf70f3bb0c77/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/MetroAreaCodes.csv) and [CountryCodes.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/763710fa6703caea1cf9c708e31e99a3/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/CountryCodes.csv), which respectively map MetroAreaCode and CountryOfBirthCode into their true values.

To measure the degree to which people are concerned about hot-button issues like Internet privacy, social scientists conduct polls in which they interview a large number of people about the topic. In this assignment, we will analyze data from a July 2013 Pew Internet and American Life Project poll on Internet anonymity and privacy, which involved interviews across the United States. While the full polling data can be found here, we will use a more limited version of the results, available in [AnonymityPoll.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/f2c3bdcba475ddd1399e001dd98f4fd0/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/AnonymityPoll.csv).\n\n***Start:***\\\nUsing read.csv(), load the dataset from AnonymityPoll.csv into a data frame called poll.\n\n```{r}\npoll <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/AnonymityPoll.csv\")\n```\n\n**1.1: How many people participated in the poll?**\\\nAnswer: 1002\n\n```{r}\nnrow(poll)\n```\n\n**1.2.1: How many interviewees responded that they use a smartphone?**\\\nAnswer: 487\n\n```{r}\nsum(poll$Smartphone, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n**1.2.2: How many interviewees responded that they don't use a smartphone?**\\\nAnswer: 472\n\n```{r}\ntable(poll$Smartphone)\n```\n\n**1.2.3: How many interviewees did not respond to the question, resulting in a missing value, or NA, in the summary() output?**\\\nAnswer: 43\n\n```{r}\nsum(is.na(poll$Smartphone))\n```\n\n**1.3.1: Which of the following are states in the Midwest census region?**\\\nAnswer: Kansas, Missouri, Ohio\n\n**1.3.2: Which was the state in the South census region with the largest number of interviewees?**\\\nAnswer: Texas\n\n```{r}\ntable(poll$Region, poll$State)\n```\n\n**2.1.1: How many interviewees reported not having used the Internet and not having used a smartphone?**\\\nAnswer: 186\n\n```{r}\ntapply(poll$Internet.Use == 0, poll$Smartphone == 0, sum, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n**2.1.2: How many interviewees reported having used the Internet and having used a smartphone?**\\\nAnswer: 470\n\n```{r}\ntapply(poll$Internet.Use, poll$Smartphone, sum, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n**2.1.3: How many interviewees reported having used the Internet but not having used a smartphone?**\\\nAnswer: 285\n\n```{r}\ntapply(poll$Internet.Use == 1, poll$Smartphone == 0, sum, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n**2.1.4: How many interviewees reported having used a smartphone but not having used the Internet?**\\\nAnswer: 17\n\n```{r}\ntapply(poll$Internet.Use == 0, poll$Smartphone == 1, sum, na.rm = TRUE)\n# Alternative to all 4 above questions: table(poll$Internet.Use, poll$Smartphone)\n```\n\n**2.2.1: How many interviewees have a missing value for their Internet use?**\\\nAnswer: 1\n\n```{r}\nsum(is.na(poll$Internet.Use))\n```\n\n**2.2.2: How many interviewees have a missing value for their smartphone use?**\\\nAnswer: 43\n\n```{r}\nsum(is.na(poll$Smartphone))\n```\n\nUse the subset function to obtain a data frame called \"limited\", which is limited to interviewees who reported Internet use or who reported smartphone use.\n\n```{r}\nlimited <- subset(poll, poll$Internet.Use == 1\n                        |poll$Smartphone == 1)\n# Alternative: limited = subset(poll, Internet.Use == 1 | Smartphone == 1)\n```\n\n**2.3: How many interviewees are in the new data frame?**\\\nAnswer: 792\n\n```{r}\nnrow(limited)\n```\n\n**3.1: Which variables have missing values in the limited data frame?**\\\nAnswer: Smartphone, Age, Conservativeness, Worry.About.Info, Privacy.Importance, Anonymity.Possible, Tried.Masking.Identity, Privacy.Laws.Effective\n\n```{r}\nsummary(limited)\nsum(is.na(limited$Sex))\nsum(is.na(limited$State))\nsum(is.na(limited$Region))\n```\n\n**3.2: What is the average number of pieces of personal information on the Internet, according to the Info.On.Internet variable?**\\\nAnswer: 3.795455\n\n```{r}\nmean(limited$Info.On.Internet)\n```\n\n**3.3.1: How many interviewees reported a value of 0 for Info.On.Internet?**\\\nAnswer: 105\n\n```{r}\nsum(limited$Info.On.Internet == 0)\n```\n\n**3.3.2: How many interviewees reported the maximum value of 11 for Info.On.Internet?**\\\nAnswer: 8\n\n```{r}\nsum(limited$Info.On.Internet == 11)\n```\n\n**3.4: What proportion of interviewees who answered the Worry.About.Info question worry about how much information is available about them on the Internet?**\\\nAnswer: 0.4886076\n\n```{r}\ntable(limited$Worry.About.Info)\n386/(404+386)\n```\n\n**3.5: What proportion of interviewees who answered the Anonymity.Possible question think it is possible to be completely anonymous on the Internet?**\\\nAnswer: 0.3691899\n\n```{r}\ntable(limited$Anonymity.Possible)\n278/(475+278)\n```\n\n**3.6: What proportion of interviewees who answered the Tried.Masking.Identity question have tried masking their identity on the Internet?**\\\nAnswer: 0.1632653\n\n```{r}\ntable(limited$Tried.Masking.Identity)\n128/(656+128)\n```\n\n**3.7: What proportion of interviewees who answered the Privacy.Laws.Effective question find United States privacy laws effective?**\\\nAnswer: 0.2558459\n\n```{r}\ntable(limited$Privacy.Laws.Effective)\n186/(541+186)\n```\n\n**4.1: Build a histogram of the age of interviewees.
